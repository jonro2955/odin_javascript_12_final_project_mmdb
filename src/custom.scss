/*Sometimes you might need to tweak the visual styles of Bootstrap (or equivalent package).

As of react-scripts@2.0.0 you can import .scss files. This makes it possible to use a package's built-in Sass variables for global style preferences.

To enable scss in Create React App you will need to install sass.

$ npm install sass

To customize Bootstrap, create a file called src/custom.scss (or similar) and import the Bootstrap source stylesheet (done below). 

Add any overrides before the imported file(s). You can reference Bootstrap's documentation for the names of the available variables.

*/

// Override default variables before the import
$body-bg: #000;

// Import Bootstrap and its default variables. You can prefix paths with ~, as displayed below, to resolve modules from node_modules
@import '~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss';

//Finally, import the newly created .scss file instead of the default Bootstrap .css in the beginning of your src/index.js file, for example:
//import './custom.scss';
