This app showcases my skills in developing responsive, aesthetic and functional web application using HTML, CSS and ReactJS.

MMDB is a movie entertainment web app. Users can look up a movie, look up its actors, watch the trailer, and browse related movies. They can also log in to save movies and review them. Such features are typical of paid video streaming sites.

MMDB accesses data on millions of movies and tv shows through [themoviedb.org API](https://www.developers.themoviedb.org).
