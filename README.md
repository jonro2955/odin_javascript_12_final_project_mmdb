This app showcases my skills in developing responsive, aesthetic and functional web application using HTML, CSS and ReactJS.

MMDB is a movie entertainment database using the [TMDB api](https://www.developers.themoviedb.org). Users can look up, review, and save movies. These features are typical of video streaming sites.

Emphasis was placed on developing features for logged in users, such as the ability to submit movie reviews. Each review submission affects the total combined score calculated with data obtained from the TMDB api.
